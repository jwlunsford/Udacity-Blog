                    <p>Black walnut <em>(Juglans nigra)</em> is a deciduous hardwood tree that grows in moist bottomland soils.
                    This tree prefers growing in sunlight but will also thrive in partial shade.  Its wood is used to make furniture, gun stocks, and high quality veneer.</p>

                    <p>The fruit of a Black Walnut tree is a nut with a hard outer green husk.  The husk contains strong tannins and toxins which can cause harm to other plants.
                        This could be an adaptive surival mechanism to keep other trees from growing nearby and stealing sunlight.  Becuase of this unique property, these husks have been used in products such as insecticides and dyes.</p>
                    <p>This is one of my all-time favorite tree speices.  Whenever I am hiking in the woods and come across a Black Walnut tree I feel the need to stop and admire it for a little while.</p>
